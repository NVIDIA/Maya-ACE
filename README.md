## What can be done

![overview](/docs/resource/mace_overview.svg)

### Send Audio, Receive Animation

Maya-ACE allows users to send audio inputs and receive corresponding facial animations. These animations can be directly connected to a blendshape node, enabling you to animate any character in Maya seamlessly.

### Learning with User-Friendly Interface

Maya-ACE provides all the necessary functionalities through a straightforward UI. It serves as an excellent tool for learning and experiencing the ACE Audio2Face service, helping users gain a deeper understanding of how it works.

### Seamless Transition to Unreal Engine and Tokkio

For those looking to expand their workflow, users can elevate their projects by transitioning to the [Kairos Unreal Engine integration](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/latest/workflows/kairos/index.html) or [Tokkio: an interactive avatar virtual customer service assistant product SDK](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/latest/workflows/tokkio/index.html).
This allows for the continued use of Audio2Face within other platforms, sharing the same parameters from Maya-ACE for a consistent experience.

### Integration with Standard Maya Nodes

Maya-ACE is designed to work seamlessly with standard Maya nodes, including the blendshape node, making it adaptable to drive any character in your scene.

### Customizable and Extendable

The source code and scripts provided with Maya-ACE can be modified to create a custom pipeline within Maya or to develop a client for other platforms, giving users the flexibility to tailor the tool to their specific needs.

### Export A2F Parameters

Export a json file with parameters from a AceAnimationPlayer

- **DISCLAIMER**: This export may not fully reflect recent updates from the server or ACE services. The following limitations may result in potential discrepancies:
  - Parameters not set and controlled by the Maya plugin will be exported with default values.
  - Default values in the exported configuration files may differ if the A2F server is deployed with custom settings.
  - To ensure consistency between the client and server, carefully compare the server's configuration with the exported parameters.
  - For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to the official website or the server configuration.

## Best Practices

### Proposed Workflow

Generally, it requires multiple tries to find an optimal setting. Users are expected to work with an iterative process with using Maya-ACE in their projects.
All animations should be downloaded to see the result through any changes; such as paramters. The typical workflow is,

1. Adjust **Parameters**
2. Update animation by clicking **Request New Animation** button
3. **Play** the scene and check the animation with audio
4. **Repeat** from 1 to 3 until satisfied with the result
5. Bake animation of the blendshape weights
6. Save the scene

### Parameter Tuning Guide

Please check
[ACE Parameter Tuning Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/latest/modules/a2f-docs/text/param_tuning.html)
to understand individual parameters.

### Save Animation through Bake Animation

Maya provides
[`Bake Simulation`](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-A11424B4-8384-4832-B18D-01264E1A19D1)
to freeze and save animation that is downloaded from the service.

1. Select blendshape node and select all blendshape weights from **the channel box**
1. Click **Bake Simulation** through menu; (Animation Layout) menu -> Keys -> Bake Simulation
<br /><img src="docs/resource/bake_animation_dialog.png" width="440" />

### Connecting Custom Blendshapes

Maya-ACE assumes to use
[ARKit compatible blendshape set](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation)
, but it is still usable with a partial set of blendshapes through this process.

Once AceAnimationPlayer receives animation, it will update output weights with blendshape names that is received from the service,
and then `Connect existing Animation Player` menu will use the names to find the best possible blendshape targets based on the names.

Rules to match blendshape names

- The blendshape name must match with one of the arkit face location
- Case insensitive

Steps to use the name-based connection

1. Finish receiving animation and update `Output Weights` of AceAnimationPlayer node with blendshape names
1. Select the AceAnimationPlayer node and the blendshape node to connect
1. Click `Connect existing Animation Player` from the menu -> ACE

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Communication errors

These are common errors when requesting new animation through Maya-ACE.

| Error Messages | Possible Reasons (not all) |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Unauthenticated | wrong api key, using http for an https endpoint |
| no authorization was passed | missing api key |
| SSL_ERROR_SSL | mismatched SSL version |
| Deadline Exceeded | bad network connection, slow machine or service, long audio |
| Cloud credits expired | out of credits |
| DNS resolution failed | network error, wrong address |
| Connection refused | service is unavailable |

### Cannot attach or connect AceAnimationPlayer

To attach AceAnimationPlayer, the selection should be a blendshape node or a mesh node with one blendshape connected.

To connect an existing AceAnimationPlayer to a new blendshape node, the selection should be one AceAnimationPlayer node and a blendshape node or a mesh with a blendshape node connected. There could be errors when,

- Selection is not in the correct order
- Selected multiple AceAnimationPlayer node or multiple blendshape node
- Selected a mesh connected with multiple blendshape nodes

Please make sure the selection is correct for each operation.

## Build and Test

### Maya Ace Client

#### Setting up Development Environment

##### Step 1: Build Tools
Please install the following build tools are accessible in your PATH environment variable.
1. MSBuild (Visual Studio 2019+)
2. python3

##### Step 2: Prepare Maya devkit
To build Maya plugins, Maya devkit is required and must be located at the correct path.

Download Maya devkit from [Autodesk website](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/maya)
and locate the devkitBase directory under `deps` directory of the local repo.

```
./deps
â””â”€â”€â”€devkitBase
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€cmake
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€devkit
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€include
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€lib
    â””â”€â”€â”€mkspecs
```

To run maya tests and use plugins, Maya application is required, and ***MAYA_LOCATION*** environment variable should be set to the [Maya's install directory](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-228CCA33-4AFE-4380-8C3D-18D23F7EAC72).

By default, Maya 2024 is expected, and the build script will copy plugin(s) to `_build/windows-x86_64/release/plguins/mace/plug-ins/2024`.

##### Step 3: Download Dependencies

The script will download required dependencies and place in `_build\target-deps`

```powershell
.\fetch_deps.bat
```

For convenience, Premake5 will be downloaded to `.\deps\premake`. Please use this version for subsequent builds or add it to your PATH variable. If you already have Premake5 installed, it should also be compatible.

#### Local Build

For a quick release build with Visual Studio 2022

```powershell
build.bat
```

To specify visual Studio version other than 2022, please change vs2022 to your installed Visual Studio version
